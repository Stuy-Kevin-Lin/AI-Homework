In other words, suppose we chose a time of 0.5 seconds: now how large should **n** be such that it takes about 0.5 seconds for _RandListSet(n)_ to run?  This, of course, is dependent upon many things: principally, the speed of your computer, but also the version of Python you're using, the particular algorithm inside _RandListSet()_, your shoe size, etc. Therefore, you can't just try _TimeIt(n)_ over and over, by hand, until you're in the ballpark of the chosen execution time.\n",
